# Python HelloWorld (for testing the Docker-Python-Autoclonable-App)

This repository serves as a testing repository for the [Docker-Python-Autoclonable-App](https://github.com/David-Lor/Docker-Python-Autoclonable-App).

The **requirements-fail** branch contains a non-existing Python package on [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) file, so the
Docker container fails on requirements installing.
